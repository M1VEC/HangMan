# HangMan
Goal is to create a movie themed HangMan from scratch

It will select a movie at random from a list

It will show the user the correct amount of letters marked as blanks

It will show the user all the letters from the alphabet 

It will keep track and show the user all in correct letters guessed

It will at the end of every guess redraw the HangMan

It will allow the user to guess the film before the start of a new guess

It could give the user one hint per movie

It could keep track of the user's hi-score or leaderboard

It should be expandable
